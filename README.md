# React + Vite 

This is a minimal and optimized starter template to build React applications with Vite. It provides fast development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and includes essential ESLint rules for code quality.

## Features

- Fast refresh and hot module replacement for instant updates  
- Minimal setup to get React running smoothly with Vite  
- ESLint integration with recommended React and JavaScript rules  
- Support for JSX and modern JavaScript features  

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official Vite plugins support React Fast Refresh:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)  
  Uses **Babel** to enable React Fast Refresh during development.  
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)  
  Uses **SWC**, a faster Rust-based compiler, for React Fast Refresh.
